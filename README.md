# Apple Stocks Tomorrow Price Predictor

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the closing price of Apple stocks for the next day using machine learning regression techniques. The regression model is developed through a series of steps, including data collection from Investing.com, data cleaning, data visualization, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured workflow:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gathered historical stock data from Investing.com, focusing on daily closing prices and relevant financial indicators.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Processed and cleaned the dataset to handle missing values and ensure data consistency.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Utilized Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing trends and correlations in the Apple stock data.

4. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Created new features, such as moving averages and technical indicators, to enhance the model's ability to capture relevant information.

5. **Model Building:**
   - Implemented a regression model using Scikit-learn, leveraging algorithms like Linear Regression or Gradient Boosting.

6. **Evaluation:**
   - Assessed the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Tools Used

- SQL for data manipulation and integration.
- Python for data analysis and machine learning.
- Scikit-learn for building and evaluating the regression model.
